# DuckyAI

## What is DuckyAI?

Have you ever wanted a rubber duck to start bouncing ideas off for command line prompts? Well now it exists! Inspired by Warp terminal and how it allows you to prompt ChatGPT for command line commands (hah!), DuckyAI allows you to ask it a question and have it give you a command to try.

## Installation

Right now, this is very manual, but you will need to do the following:

1. Create an .env file and plop in an OpenAI API key (with the config option OPENAI_API_KEY)
2. Run `pnpm build`
3. Run `pnpm install -g` in the root directory.

Voila! You can now run ducky anywhere by running the command `ducky`

## Usage

Coming soon!
